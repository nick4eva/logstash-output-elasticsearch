# This plugin is the recommended method of storing logs in Elasticsearch.
# If you plan on using the Kibana web interface, you'll want to use this output.
#
# This output only speaks the HTTP protocol. HTTP is the preferred protocol for interacting with Elasticsearch as of Logstash 2.0.
# We strongly encourage the use of HTTP over the node protocol for a number of reasons. HTTP is only marginally slower,
# yet far easier to administer and work with. When using the HTTP protocol one may upgrade Elasticsearch versions without having
# to upgrade Logstash in lock-step. For those still wishing to use the node or transport protocols please see
# the <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch_java,elasticsearch_java output plugin>>.
#
# You can learn more about Elasticsearch at <https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>
#
# ==== Retry Policy
#
# The retry policy has changed significantly in the 2.2.0 release.
# This plugin uses the Elasticsearch bulk API to optimize its imports into Elasticsearch. These requests may experience
# either partial or total failures.
#
# The following errors are retried infinitely:
#
# - Network errors (inability to connect)
# - 429 (Too many requests) and
# - 503 (Service unavailable) errors
#
# NOTE: 409 exceptions are no longer retried. Please set a higher `retry_on_conflict` value if you experience 409 exceptions.
# It is more performant for Elasticsearch to retry these exceptions than this plugin.
#
# ==== DNS Caching
#
# This plugin uses the JVM to lookup DNS entries and is subject to the value of https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/net/properties.html[networkaddress.cache.ttl],
# a global setting for the JVM.
#
# As an example, to set your DNS TTL to 1 second you would set
# the `LS_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable to `-Dnetworkaddress.cache.ttl=1`.
#
# Keep in mind that a connection with keepalive enabled will
# not reevaluate its DNS value while the keepalive is in effect.

  # The Elasticsearch action to perform. Valid actions are:
  #
  # - index: indexes a document (an event from Logstash).
  # - delete: deletes a document by id (An id is required for this action)
  # - create: indexes a document, fails if a document by that id already exists in the index.
  # - update: updates a document by id. Update has a special case where you can upsert -- update a
  #   document if not already present. See the `upsert` option. NOTE: This does not work and is not supported
  #   in Elasticsearch 1.x. Please upgrade to ES 2.x or greater to use this feature with Logstash!
  # - A sprintf style string to change the action based on the content of the event. The value `%{[foo]}`
  #   would use the foo field for the action
